hemisphere varying three twelve degrees north minima found subtropical regions northern southern hemispheres beyond albedo increases without respect illumination ===insolation effects === intensity albedo temperature effects depend amount albedo level local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas arctic antarctic regions cold due low insolation areas sahara desert also relatively high albedo hotter due high insolation tropical subtropical rainforest areas low albedo much hotter temperate forest counterparts lower insolation insolation play big role heating cooling effects albedo high insolation areas like tropics tend show pronounced fluctuation local temperature local albedo changes arctic regions notably release heat back space absorb effectively cooling earth concern since arctic ice snow melting higher rates due higher temperatures creating regions arctic notably darker being water ground darker color reflects less heat back space feedback loop results reduced albedo effect ===climate weather=== albedo affects climate determining much radiation planet absorbs uneven heating earth albedo variations land ice ocean surfaces drive weather ===albedo–temperature feedback=== areas albedo changes due snowfall snow–temperature feedback results layer snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading local cooling principle outside temperature change affects area eg warm air mass raised albedo lower temperature would maintain current snow invite snowfall deepening snow–temperature feedback however local weather dynamic due change seasons eventually warm air masses direct angle sunlight higher insolation cause melting melted area reveals surfaces lower albedo grass soil effect reversed darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures induces melting thus reducing albedo resulting still heating ===snow=== snow albedo highly variable ranging high 09 freshly fallen snow 04 melting snow low 02 dirty snow antarctica average little 08 marginally snowcovered area warms snow tends melt lowering albedo hence leading snowmelt radiation absorbed snowpack the ice–albedo positive feedback cryoconite powdery windblown

7,===logic=== aristotle portrayed 1493 nuremberg chronicle prior analytics aristotle credited earliest study formal logic conception dominant form western logic 19th century advances mathematical logic kant stated critique pure reason preface second edition 1787 aristotle logic reached completion ====history==== aristotle says on subject reasoning had nothing else earlier date speak of however plato reports syntax devised prodicus ceos concerned correct use words logic seems emerged dialectics earlier philosophers made frequent use concepts like reductio ad absurdum discussions never truly understood logical implications even plato difficulties logic although reasonable conception deductive system could never actually construct one thus relied instead dialectic plato believed deduction would simply follow premises hence focused maintaining solid premises conclusion would logically follow consequently plato realized method obtaining conclusions would beneficial never succeeded devising method best attempt published book sophist introduced division method ====analytics organon==== today call aristotelian logic aristotle would labeled analytics term logic reserved mean dialectics aristotles work probably original form likely edited students later lecturers logical works aristotle compiled six books early 1st century ce  categories  on interpretation  prior analytics  posterior analytics  topics  on sophistical refutations order books or teachings composed certain list derived analysis aristotles writings go basics analysis simple terms categories analysis propositions elementary relations on interpretation study complex forms namely syllogisms in analytics dialectics in topics sophistical refutations first three treatises form core logical theory stricto sensu grammar language logic correct rules reasoning one volume aristotles concerning logic found organon namely fourth book metaphysics ===aristotles epistemology=== plato left aristotle right detail the school athens fresco raphael aristotle gestures earth representing belief knowledge empirical observation experience holding copy nicomachean ethics hand whilst plato gestures heavens representing belief forms holding copy timaeus ancient roman mosaic depicting aristotle römischgermanisches museum koln germany like teacher plato aristotles philosophy aims universal aristotles ontology however finds universal particular things calls essence things platos ontology universal exists apart particular things related prototype exemplar aristotle therefore epistemology based study particular phenomena rises knowledge essences plato epistemology begins knowledge universal forms or ideas descends knowledge particular imitations these aristotle form still refers unconditional basis phenomena instantiated particular substance see universals particulars below certain sense aristotles method inductive deductive platos essentially deductive a priori principles aristotles terminology natural philosophy branch philosophy examining phenomena natural world includes fields would regarded today physics biology natural sciences modern times scope philosophy become limited generic abstract inquiries ethics metaphysics logic play major role todays philosophy tends exclude empirical study natural world means scientific method contrast aristotles philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually facets intellectual inquiry larger sense word aristotle makes philosophy coextensive reasoning also would describe science note however use term science carries different meaning covered term scientific method aristotle all science dianoia either practical poetical theoretical metaphysics 1025b25 practical science means ethics politics poetical science means study poetry fine arts theoretical science means physics mathematics metaphysics logic or analytics regarded study preliminary philosophy divisions aristotelian philosophy would consist of 1 logic 2 theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics mathematics 3 practical philosophy 4 poetical philosophy period two stays athens times academy lyceum aristotle conducted scientific thinking research renowned today fact aristotles life devoted study objects natural science aristotles metaphysics contains observations nature numbers made original contributions mathematics however perform original research natural sciences eg botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology several sciences aristotles writings science largely qualitative opposed quantitative beginning 16th century scientists began applying mathematics physical sciences aristotles work area deemed hopelessly inadequate failings largely due absence concepts like mass velocity force temperature conception speed temperature quantitative understanding partly due absence basic experimental devices like clocks thermometers writings provide account many scientific observations mixture precocious accuracy curious errors example history animals claimed human males teeth females similar vein john philoponus later galileo showed simple experiments aristotles theory heavier object falls faster lighter object incorrect hand aristotle refuted democrituss claim milky way made those stars shaded earth suns rays pointing correctly even reasoning bound dismissed long time given current astronomical demonstrations the size sun greater earth distance stars earth many times greater sun  sun shines stars earth screens none them aristotle also scientific blind spots posited geocentric cosmology may discern selections metaphysics widely accepted 16th century 3rd century 16th century dominant view held earth rotational center universe perhaps philosopher respected european thinkers renaissance thinkers often took aristotles erroneous positions given held back science epoch however aristotles scientific shortcomings mislead one forgetting great advances many scientific fields instance founded logic formal science created foundations biology superseded two millennia moreover introduced fundamental notion nature composed things change studying changes provide useful knowledge underlying constants ===geology=== quoted charles lyells principles geology aristotle refers many examples changes constantly go insists emphatically great results must produce lapse ages instances particular cases lakes dried deserts length become watered rivers fertilized points growth nilotic delta since time homer shallowing palus maeotis within sixty years time  alludes  upheaving one eolian islands previous volcanic eruption changes earth says slow comparison duration lives overlooked migrations people great catastrophes removal regions cause event forgotten says 12th chapter meteorics the distribution land sea particular regions endure throughout time becomes sea parts land becomes land sea reason thinking changes take place according certain system within certain period concluding observation follows as time never fails universe eternal neither tanais nile flowed ever places rise dry limit operations none time also rivers spring perish sea also continually deserts lands invades others tracts therefore earth always sea others always continents every thing changes course time ===physics=== ====five elements==== aristotle proposed fifth element aether addition four proposed earlier empedocles  earth cold dry corresponds modern idea solid  water cold wet corresponds modern idea liquid  air hot wet corresponds modern idea gas  fire hot dry corresponds modern ideas plasma heat  aether divine substance makes heavenly spheres heavenly bodies stars planets four earthly elements natural place earthly tends toward center universe ie center earth water tends toward sphere surrounding center air tends toward sphere surrounding water sphere fire tends toward lunar sphere in moon orbits elements moved natural place naturally move back towards it natural motion – motion requiring extrinsic cause example water earthy bodies sink air bubbles rise up air rain falls flame rises outside spheres heavenly fifth element manifested stars planets moves perfection circles ====motion==== aristotle defined motion actuality potentiality as such aquinas suggested passage understood literally motion indeed understood active fulfillment potential transition toward potentially possible state actuality potentiality normally opposites aristotle commentators either suggest wording come us erroneous addition as such definition critical understanding it ====causality four causes==== aristotle suggested reason anything coming attributed four different types simultaneously active factors name aitia traditionally translated cause always refer temporal sequence might better translated explanation traditional rendering employed here  material cause describes material something composed thus material cause table wood material cause car rubber steel action mean one domino knocks another domino  formal cause form ie arrangement matter tells us thing thing determined definition form pattern essence whole synthesis archetype embraces account causes terms fundamental principles general laws whole ie macrostructure cause parts relationship known wholepart causation plainly put formal cause idea existing first place exemplar mind sculptor second place intrinsic determining cause embodied matter formal cause could refer essential quality causation simple example formal cause mental image idea allows artist architect engineer create drawing  efficient cause the primary source change consideration proceeds identifies what makes made causes change changed suggests sorts agents nonliving living acting sources change movement rest representing current understanding causality relation cause effect covers modern definitions cause either agent agency particular events states affairs take two dominoes time equal weighting first knocked causing second also fall over  final cause telos purpose sake thing exists done including purposeful instrumental actions activities final cause purpose function something supposed serve covers modern ideas motivating causes volition need desire ethics spiritual beliefs additionally things causes one another causing reciprocally hard work causes fitness vice versa although way function one beginning change goal thus aristotle first suggested reciprocal circular causality relation mutual dependence influence cause upon effect moreover aristotle indicated thing cause contrary effects presence absence may result different outcomes simply goal purpose brings event two dominoes require someone something intentionally knock first domino cannot fall accord aristotle marked two modes causation proper prior causation accidental chance causation causes proper incidental spoken actual potential generic particular language refers effects causes actual effects assigned operating causes generic effects generic causes particular effects particular causes ====optics==== aristotle held accurate theories optical concepts philosophers day second oldest written evidence camera obscura after mozi c 400 bc found aristotles documentation device 350 bc problemata aristotles apparatus contained dark chamber single small hole aperture allow sunlight enter aristotle used device make observations sun noted matter shape hole sun would still correctly displayed round object modern cameras analogous diaphragm aristotle also made observation distance aperture surface image increased image magnified ====chance spontaneity==== according aristotle spontaneity chance causes things distinguishable types cause chance incidental cause lies realm accidental things from spontaneous but note spontaneous come chance better understanding aristotles conception chance might better think coincidence something takes place chance person sets intent one thing take place result another thing not intended taking place example person seeks donations person may find another person willing donate substantial sum however person seeking donations met person donating purpose collecting donations purpose aristotle would call collecting donation particular donator result chance must unusual something happens chance words something happens time cannot say chance also specific kind chance aristotle names luck apply human beings sphere moral actions according aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation humans capable deliberation choice what capable action cannot anything chance ===metaphysics=== aristotle defines metaphysics the knowledge immaterial being being highest degree abstraction refers metaphysics first philosophy well the theologic science ====substance potentiality actuality==== aristotle examines concepts substance essence ousia metaphysics book vii concludes particular substance combination matter form book viii distinguishes matter substance substratum stuff composed example matter house bricks stones timbers etc whatever constitutes potential house form substance actual house namely covering bodies chattels differentia see also predicables let us define something house formula gives components account matter formula gives differentia account form regard change kinesis causes defines physics on generation corruption 319b–320a distinguishes coming from  growth diminution change quantity  locomotion change space  alteration change quality coming change nothing persists resultant property particular change introduces concept potentiality dynamis actuality entelecheia association matter form referring potentiality thing capable acted upon conditions right prevented something else example seed plant soil potentially dynamei plant prevented something become plant potentially beings either act poiein be acted upon paschein either innate learned example eyes possess potentiality sight innate – acted upon capability play flute possessed learning exercise – acting actuality fulfillment end potentiality end telos principle every change sake end exists potentiality therefore actuality end referring previous example could say actuality plant one activities plants do sake thing principle becoming sake end actuality end sake potentiality acquired animals see order may sight sight may see summary matter used make house potentiality house activity building form final house actualities also final cause end aristotle proceeds concludes actuality prior potentiality formula time substantiality definition particular substance ie matter form aristotle tries solve problem unity beings example what makes man one since according plato two ideas animal biped man unity however according aristotle potential matter actual one form one thing ====universals particulars==== aristotles predecessor plato argued things universal form could either property relation things look apple example see apple also analyze form apple distinction particular apple universal form apple moreover place apple next book speak book apple next other plato argued universal forms part particular things example possible particular good existence good still proper universal form bertrand russell 20thcentury philosopher agreed plato existence uninstantiated universals aristotle disagreed plato point arguing universals instantiated aristotle argued universals unattached existing things according aristotle universal exists either particular relation must must currently must future something universal predicated consequently according aristotle case universal predicated object exists period time exist addition aristotle disagreed plato location universals plato spoke world forms location universal forms subsist aristotle maintained universals exist within thing universal predicated according aristotle form apple exists within apple rather world forms ===biology medicine=== aristotelian science especially biology things saw stood test time better retelling reports others contain error superstition dissected animals humans ideas human body works almost entirely superseded ====empirical research program==== octopus swimming torpedo fuscomaculata leopard shark aristotle earliest natural historian whose work survived detail aristotle certainly research natural history lesbos surrounding seas neighbouring areas works reflect research history animals generation animals movement animals parts animals contain observations interpretations along sundry myths mistakes striking passages sealife visible observation lesbos available catches fishermen observations catfish electric fish torpedo anglerfish detailed writing cephalopods namely octopus sepia cuttlefish paper nautilus argonauta argo description hectocotyl arm used sexual reproduction widely disbelieved rediscovery 19th century separated aquatic mammals fish knew sharks rays part group called selachē selachians example methods including dissection observation comes generation animals describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs intervals discover sequence visible organs generated aristotle gave accurate descriptions fourchambered forestomachs ruminants ovoviviparous embryological development hound shark mustelus mustelus ====classification living things==== aristotle distinguished 500 species birds mammals fishes modern zoologist would call vertebrates invertebrates aristotle called animals blood animals without blood animals blood divided livebearing mammals eggbearing birds fish invertebrates animals without blood insects crustacea divided nonshelled – cephalopods – shelled testacea molluscs aristotle believed intellectual purposes ie final causes guided natural processes teleological view gave aristotle cause justify observed data expression formal design noting no animal time tusks horns a singlehooved animal two horns never seen aristotle suggested nature giving animal horns tusks staving vanity giving creatures faculties degree necessary noting ruminants multiple stomachs weak teeth supposed first compensate latter nature trying preserve type balance stated history animals creatures arranged graded scale perfection rising minerals plants animals man forming scala naturae great chain being system eleven grades arranged according to degree infected potentiality expressed form birth highest animals laid warm wet creatures alive lowest bore cold dry thick eggs charles singer nothing remarkable aristotles efforts exhibit relationships living things scala naturae aristotle also held level creatures perfection reflected form preordained form ideas like ideas souls regarded science modern times placed emphasis types soul organism possessed asserting plants possess vegetative soul responsible reproduction growth animals vegetative sensitive soul responsible mobility sensation humans vegetative sensitive rational soul capable thought reflection aristotle contrast earlier philosophers accordance egyptians placed rational soul heart rather brain notable aristotles division sensation thought generally go previous philosophers exception alcmaeon ====successor theophrastus==== frontispiece 1644 version expanded illustrated edition historia plantarum ca 1200 originally written around 300 bc aristotles successor lyceum theophrastus wrote series books botany – history plants – survived important contribution antiquity botany even middle ages many theophrastus names survive modern times carpos fruit pericarpion seed vessel rather focus formal causes aristotle theophrastus suggested mechanistic scheme drawing analogies natural artificial processes relying aristotles concept efficient cause theophrastus also recognized role sex reproduction higher plants though last discovery lost later ages ====influence hellenistic medicine==== theophrastus lyceum failed produce original work though interest aristotles ideas survived generally taken unquestioningly age alexandria ptolemies advances biology found first medical teacher alexandria herophilus chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence brain connected nervous system motion sensation herophilus also distinguished veins arteries noting latter pulse former not though ancient atomists lucretius challenged teleological viewpoint aristotelian ideas life teleology and rise christianity natural theology would remain central biological thought essentially 18th 19th centuries ernst mayr claimed nothing real consequence biology lucretius galen renaissance aristotles ideas natural history medicine survived generally taken unquestioningly ===psychology=== aristotles psychology given treatise on soul peri psyche often known latin title de anima posits three kinds soul psyches vegetative soul sensitive soul rational soul humans rational soul kind soul capable powers kinds like vegetative soul grow nourish itself like sensitive soul experience sensations move locally unique part human rational soul ability receive forms things compare them aristotle soul psyche simpler concept us today soul simply meant form living being beings composites form matter form living beings endows specific living beings eg ability initiate movement or case plants growth chemical transformations aristotle considers types movement ====memory==== according aristotle memory ability hold perceived experience mind ability distinguish internal appearance occurrence past words memory mental picture phantasm aristotle defines de anima appearance imprinted part body forms memory aristotle believed imprint becomes impressed semifluid bodily organ undergoes several changes order make memory memory occurs stimuli complex nervous system semifluid bodily organ cannot receive impressions once changes involved operations sensation common sense thinking  mental picture imprinted bodily organ final product entire process sense perception matter experience seen heard every experience ends mental image memory aristotle uses word memory two basic abilities first actual retaining experience mnemonic imprint develop sensation second intellectual anxiety comes imprint due impressed particular time processing specific contents abilities explained memory neither sensation thinking arises lapse time therefore memory past prediction future sensation present retrieval imprints cannot performed suddenly transitional channel needed located past experiences previous experience present experience aristotle proposed slowwitted people good memory fluids brain wash away memory organ used imprint experiences imprint easily continue however cannot slow hardened surface organ receive new imprints believed young old properly develop imprint young people undergo rapid changes develop elderlys organs beginning decay thus stunting new imprints likewise people quickwitted similar young image cannot fixed rapid changes organ intellectual functions involved memory memories belong animals perception time =====recollection===== aristotle believes people receive kinds sense perceptions people perceive images imprints people continually weaving together new imprints things experience order search imprints people search memory itself within memory one experience offered instead specific memory person reject experience find looking for recollection occurs one experience naturally follows another chain images needed one memory stimulate other chain images needed expected stimulate memory instances people recall experiences stimulate certain previous experiences stimulated one needed recollection selfdirected activity retrieving information stored memory imprint time passed retrieval stored information dependent scope mnemonic capabilities human animal abilities human animal possesses humans remember imprints intellectual activity numbers words animals perception time able retrieve memories past observations remembering involves perception things remembered time passed recollection imprint present experiences person remembers similar elements corresponding character arrangement past sensory experiences imprint recalled may bring forth large group related imprints aristotle believed chain thought ends recollection certain imprints connected systematically three sorts relationships similarity contrast contiguity three laws make laws association aristotle believed past experiences hidden within mind force operates awaken hidden material bring actual experience according aristotle association power innate mental state operates upon unexpressed remains former experiences allowing rise recalled ====dreams==== =====sleep===== understanding aristotles views dreams first idea sleep must examined aristotle gives account explanation sleep on sleep wakefulness sleep takes place result overuse senses digestion vital body including senses revitalized person asleep critical activities include thinking sensing recalling remembering function wakefulness since person cannot sense sleep also desire result sensation however senses able work sleep albeit differently person awake sleep person still sensory experiences also senses inactive sleep ones weary =====theory dreams===== dreams involve actually sensing stimulus discussed senses work normally sleep dreams sensation still involved altered manner awake aristotle explains phenomenon occurs person stares moving stimulus waves body water look away stimulus next thing look appears moving wave like motion person perceives stimulus stimulus longer focus attention leaves impression body awake senses functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli sense impressions left previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant however sleep impressions stimuli made throughout day become noticed new sensory experiences distract impressions made dreams result lasting impressions since impressions left exact stimuli dreams resemble actual experience occurred awake sleep person altered state mind aristotle compares sleeping person person overtaken strong feelings toward stimulus example person strong infatuation someone may begin think see person everywhere overtaken feelings person asleep senses acting awake results thinking like person influenced strong feelings since person sleeping suggestible state become easily deceived appears dreams asleep person unable make judgments awake due senses functioning normally sleep unable help person judge happening dream turn leads person believe dream real dreams may absurd nature senses able discern whether real not dreamer left accept dream lack choice judge it one component aristotles theory dreams introduces ideas contradictory previously held beliefs claimed dreams foretelling sent divine being aristotle reasoned instances dreams resemble future events happenstances divinations ideas contradictory believed dreams time introduced ideas thinkers beginning give naturalistic opposed supernatural explanations phenomena aristotle also includes theory dreams constitutes dream not claimed dream first established fact person asleep experience it person image appear moment waking see something dark considered dream awake occurred secondly sensory experience actually occurs person asleep perceived person asleep qualify part dream example person sleeping door shuts dream hear door shut aristotle argues sensory experience part dream actual sensory experience perceived senses fact occurred person asleep make part dream lastly images dreams must result lasting impressions sensory experiences awake ===practical philosophy=== ====ethics==== aristotle considered ethics practical rather theoretical study ie one aimed becoming good good rather knowing sake wrote several treatises ethics including notably nicomachean ethics aristotle taught virtue proper function ergon thing eye good eye much see proper function eye sight aristotle reasoned humans must function specific humans function must activity psuchē normally translated soul accordance reason logos aristotle identified optimum activity soul aim human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated happiness sometimes well being potential ever happy way necessarily requires good character ēthikē aretē often translated moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught achieve virtuous potentially happy character requires first stage fortune habituated deliberately teachers experience leading later stage one consciously chooses best things best people come live life way practical wisdom phronesis intellect nous develop towards highest possible human virtue wisdom accomplished theoretical speculative thinker words philosopher ====politics==== aristotles classification constitutions addition works ethics address individual aristotle addressed city work titled politics aristotle considered city natural community moreover considered city prior importance family turn prior individual for whole must necessity prior part also famously stated man nature political animal also arguing humanitys defining factor among others animal kingdom rationality aristotle conceived politics like organism rather like machine collection parts none exist without others aristotles conception city organic considered one first conceive city manner common modern understanding political community modern state quite different aristotles understanding although aware existence potential larger empires natural community according aristotle city polis functions political community partnership koinōnia aim city avoid injustice economic stability rather allow least citizens possibility live good life perform beautiful acts the political partnership must regarded therefore sake noble actions sake living together distinguished modern approaches beginning social contract theory according individuals leave state nature fear violent death inconveniences excerpt speech character

live bravely likewise selfcontrolled man live selfcontrol clear intelligent man choose intelligent function capacity hence its evident according authoritative judgment intelligence supreme among goods ====rhetoric poetics==== aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry music imitative varying imitation medium object manner example music imitates media rhythm harmony whereas dance imitates rhythm alone poetry language forms also differ object imitation comedy instance dramatic imitation men worse average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better average lastly forms differ manner imitation – narrative character change change drama drama aristotle believed imitation natural mankind constitutes one mankinds advantages animals believed aristotles poetics comprised two books – one comedy one tragedy – portion focuses tragedy survived aristotle taught tragedy composed six elements plotstructure character style thought spectacle lyric poetry characters tragedy merely means driving story plot characters chief focus tragedy tragedy imitation action arousing pity fear meant effect catharsis emotions aristotle concludes poetics discussion either superior epic tragic mimesis suggests tragedy possesses attributes epic possibly possesses additional attributes spectacle music unified achieves aim mimesis shorter scope considered superior epic aristotle keen systematic collector riddles folklore proverbs school special interest riddles delphic oracle studied fables aesop ===views women=== aristotles analysis procreation describes active ensouling
